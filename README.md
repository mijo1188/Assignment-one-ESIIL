## About me
Hi all! My name is Michela Johnson, i'm currently studying environmental engineering at CU Boulder. My interest lie with renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, hydraulics, pollution control technologies, earth data science, and much more! This will be my second summer with the Earth Data lab. Last summer I was in the Earth Data Science Corp (EDSC) program and learned a ton of skills I still use everyday! I have two kitties in my life one is named Pierre and my childhood cat Fancy, I love them very much! I look forwards to working with you all!
